        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven
                <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the dough
                <p>
                Mix together ground walnuts, sugar, 3 egg yolks, cardamom, baking soda, and rose water in a medium bowl until well blended. Roll teaspoon-sized pieces of dough into balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add final touches
                <p>
                Whisk together remaining egg yolk and water using a fork. Press a walnut piece into each cookie, then brush with egg yolk glaze.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the cookies
                <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. The cookies will appear soft and undercooked but they will harden considerably when cooled.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool & serve
                <p>
                Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
                </p>
