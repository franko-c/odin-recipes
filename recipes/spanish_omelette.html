        <h2>Spanish Omelette</h2>
        <img src="../images/spanish-omelette.webp" alt="A birds eye view of a spanish omelette; onion and potato slices, fried and then combined into whisked eggs." width="300">

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p class="left">It is often decreed that the only ingredients (other than eggs of course) proper to a Spanish omelette are onions and potatoes, but I like a touch of red from some chopped peppers.</p> 
        <p class="left">I am sorry if this offends — and not only the Spanish — but you could speed this up by using some drained, canned new potatoes instead of cooking real ones.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>½ pound potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="left">Optional Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook onions & potatoes
                <p>
                Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add potatoes and season lightly with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 14 minutes. Add onions; cook and stir until soft and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
                </p>    
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk & combine the eggs
                <p>
                Whisk eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour eggs into the skillet and stir gently to combine with potatoes and onion. Reduce the heat to low and cook until eggs begin to brown on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip the omelette
                <p>
                Loosen omelette with a spatula. Invert a large plate over the pan, and carefully flip omelette out onto the plate. Slide omelette, uncooked-side down, back into the pan. Cook until eggs are set, 4 to 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Serve & garnish
                <p>
                Serve warm, garnished with tomato and green onion.
                </p>
