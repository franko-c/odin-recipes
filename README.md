### Spanish Omelette

  

A Spanish omelette is made with tender fried potatoes and onions cooked with eggs for a hearty meal or delicious tapas dish that everyone will enjoy.

  

### Coriander Rice

  

This easy-to-make cilantro and lime rice is even better than Chipotle's and will be your new go-to for taco or burrito night.

  

### Persian Cookies

  

These rose-scented Persian cookies are delicately spiced. They're the perfect treat for Passover since they contain no flour. Nutty, rich, and slightly chewy with a crunchy exterior.
